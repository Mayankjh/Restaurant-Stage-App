## FEND PROJECT 5

# Restaurant Reviews
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.


# Running the Project
1) Add your keys for google maps in the app.js file line 1.
2) Serve the index.html file through an HTTP server. I used Atom as my IDE and Atom Live server Package to run and test my code.
3) Else you can host your file through python server as :
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
